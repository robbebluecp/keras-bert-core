# INTRODUCTION    
This is a bert project constructed with tf2+(mainly with tf.keras). It's easily to use raw bert weights and easily fine-tune into your own model.
Demos show you how to use bert to do some easy tasks and tasks show your how to fine-tune bert. Now, just go.  

# INSTALLATION  
git clone https://github.com/robbebluecp/tf2-bert.git  

# FILES  
 * data :-> for placing training data
 * model_train :-> for saving models or weights files
 * tools :-> helper functions, mainly including tokenizer now 
 * config  :-> configuration file
 * models :-> core models like BERT and CRF
 * demos :-> demos
 * tasks :-> fine-tune tasks
 

 # HOW TO USE  
 * Just follow the demos and tasks. Before running, remember ro download NER and comment data from
 [https://github.com/robbebluecp/tf2-bert/releases/download/1.0.0/BERT_COMMENT.zip](https://github.com/robbebluecp/tf2-bert/releases/download/1.0.0/BERT_COMMENT.zip)
 and [https://github.com/robbebluecp/tf2-bert/releases/download/1.0.0/BERT_NER.zip](https://github.com/robbebluecp/tf2-bert/releases/download/1.0.0/BERT_NER.zip),
 then unzip then into data directory.
